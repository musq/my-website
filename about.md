Hi, I'm Ashish. I love computers and the endless possibilities they
offer. Programming is to build beautiful products and contributing
to the [vision of Mr. Richard Stallman](https://youtu.be/L4qNuoSwmPo).

Stories about people who challenged the system for upliftment of the
society using software, fascinate me.

US export law

- Richard Stallman created GNU operating system after being denied
Xerox printer's source code

- Elon Musk on becoming a spacefaring civilization makes him get up
in the morning ([source](https://youtu.be/zu7WJD8vpAQ?t=1724))
- Aaron Swartz and his fight for free and open information

**I believe in privacy as a fundamental right.**

On a lighter note, I occasionally make sketch portraits of happy
people :)

Enjoy!
