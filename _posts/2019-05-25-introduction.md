Welcome!

Over the past couple of years I've come across some really beautiful
stories, tools and lessons on the internet. Few of them have had
significant impact on my life in terms of organization, thought
process, decision making, and productivity. This blog is supposed to
reflect my understanding of them. For brevity's sake, I'll try to keep
each post as concise as possible.

Hopefully, you'll find them interesting.
