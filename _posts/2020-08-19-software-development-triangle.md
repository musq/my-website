Choose any two â€” Maintainable, Configurable, Speed.

When creating a new software, you could only have two out of the
following:

- **Maintainable**
- **Configurable**
- **Speed**

If you choose to focus on maintainability and configurability, it'll
take a long time to develop and performance might be impacted.

If you choose to focus on maintainability and speed (of development and
performance), you might not have a configurable system (i.e. with many
features and options).

If you choose to focus on lots of configurations and speed, you might
have to sacrifice maintainability of your software.
