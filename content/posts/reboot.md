Nature brings new life builds on the Earth server every couple of
millenia. The senior developers nerf the laziest ones, once in a while.
Recently, the wrecking job has been outsourced to inexperienced junior
developers (humans). They have been upgrading the server mercilessly
with random patches. Now, the senior devs have started wondering ---

- Are the resources being overclocked?
- Are some of the hotfixes causing more bugs? *(stares at plastic)*
- Which new features to push in the next 30 years?
- Should the human build be dropped entirely?
