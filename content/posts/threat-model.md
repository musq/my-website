Security is not an absolute concept. All of us have a different undestanding of ***a dangerous situation***. We assess the gravity of a threat by benchmarking it against our comfort level. A well-known concept of armor is the theory of threat models.

Basically, you have to ---

- Identify the threat
- Assess the risks
- Limit your exposure

There are 5 categories of threats ---

1. Organizations - They perform the most generic survellience and don't have a specific target per se. Once they've generated enough data, they'll begin categorizing preys as per their benefits.
1. Governments - They at least have a determined survellience target, e.g. it's citizens, foreign diplomats, companies, etc.
1. Intruders - They are basically hackers who know about you and want to target you specifically for various nefarious purposes.
1. Aquantainces - Your friends/colleagues might also be interested in intruding your privacy. So, you may not trust them because of various personal reasons.
1. Family - Finally, there are things that you want to keep to yourself. Not even your family needs to know about it because you believe it might be dangerous for them to about it, or you might be in danger for telling other people.

These are the 5 levels of threat which you should keep in mind. Whenever you're sharing a private detail, identify the threat, assess the risks, limit your exposure. Every information you have should be guarded behind a series of walls to which you limit the visibility to authorized people.

Categories 1-3 are non-personal kinda things and they may involve social engineering tactics.



When we image a dangerous situation, we have different images in mind.

Basically, you have to identify the threats, assess the risks and limit your exposure. Build a threat model.

First we have to identify the threats, assess it and build a threat model to protect ourselves.

- Governments
