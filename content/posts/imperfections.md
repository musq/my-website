What is so great about being perfect? Why do we want to attain the pinnacle? A peak points to the fact that we can do absolutely nothing more to improve. Everything else is inferior. It implies ego. Let's be honest. Perfection is narcissism.

Do humans have a limit? I believe not. So the concept of an impeccable doesn't quite sound right.

On the contrary, imperfections show us that we have something to look forward to, something to work upon. They lead us into the future. They are the evidence that we are alive.

Let's celebrate our imperfections!
