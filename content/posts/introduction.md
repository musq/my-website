Welcome!

Over the past couple of years I've encountered some really beautiful
stories, tools and lessons on the internet. Few of them have had
significant impact on my life in terms of organization, thought
process, decision making, and productivity. This blog is supposed to
reflect my understanding of them. For the sake of brevity, I'll try to keep the
length of each post as concise as I possibly can.

Hopefully, you'll find them interesting.
