When depression knocks the door.

While trawling one of my favourite repos -
[**exa**](https://github.com/ogham/exa), I stumbled upon something I
would never have expected. A heartful message from its author when he
wasn't at his best.

This is as real as it gets. Unfortunately nobody knows about it, because
we don't talk about it.

> [**exa v0.4.1 (basically a pre-release
> v0.5.0)**](https://github.com/ogham/exa/releases/tag/v0.4.1) **— Mar
> 29, 2017**

> *This is a snapshot of exa's current code, which has been cleaned up a
> bit and at the very least been run through untry (which managed to
> pick apart all try!s but one). It's being released to work around a
> bug in macOS Sierra.*

> *Usually when I do a release I go through the commit history, pick out
> anything that looks like it could be a bullet point in the release
> notes, look at the contributors and see who's there, then edit the
> website and upload — there are more features in here than just the
> openssl upgrade, and the work done so far is really deserving of a
> "proper" release, rather than just a beta.*

> *But I don't even want to learn how little work I've done on it in the
> past twelve months.*

> *I think I need to be honest with everyone here. My interest in exa is
> still there, and the list of features I'd still like to add is as long
> as it's ever been, but my motivation is completely shot. Compared to
> even a year ago it's plummeted. Every day I go to work, bang out code
> on whatever it is I'm doing, leave, arrive home, then do my best to
> not do anything, on the computer or off it. My life's going alright, I
> can still do things, I'm able to do things, but I just... don't, and I
> wish I could give you a better reason than that. GitHub notifications
> were something I'd deal with later that day, then next week, then
> whenever I'd get around to it, and then routed into a folder in my
> inbox that I never actually checked, and then every day I'd see that
> number and hope it didn't increase, and then I noticed that whenever
> it did increase I wouldn't be able to concentrate on anything for
> another hour, so I just hid it, which hurt at first but at least gave
> me some time back. I'd still commit from time to time, but not mention
> any of this because I didn't want to call attention to it, as though
> in time everyone would just forget. Whenever I saw a reply to the
> Sierra bug thread, I'd log in, read it, start to worry that if I
> replied now then I'd be admitting to everyone that I was still around
> and hadn't died or something and was instead just ignoring their
> comments, and then what would people think of me? I even got as far as
> navigating to "Delete this repository" before I had to push the
> computer away.*

> *That's one push that went correctly. It's obvious to say, but it's
> stupid to delete code that people are using, just because you didn't
> want to deal with the fact that you made a mistake.*

> *I'm going to try something new:* ***switching exa to a routine 6-week
> release schedule***. *The Rust has a release train that works over the
> same duration using multiple versions. I think exa (a hundredth its
> size) can do without that part, but the rest of it is good advice.
> Having an actual date for each one means I don't get a choice in
> releasing anything or not, which is an incredible motivator for
> actually doing it! I still have to put 0.5.0 out properly, but with
> luck, the second release (0.6.0, which would come out halfway through
> May) would be a lot less daunting than the first, the third less than
> the second, and it would plateau from there.*

> *The root advice here is "if you're having difficulty doing something,
> then do it more often, because it gets easier". I found actually
> releasing my software hard. I want it to be easier.*

> *I hope you all find this acceptable, and I apologise again for the
> massive commit lacuna.*
