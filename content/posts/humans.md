- A mere obstacle will not stop me from creating something I deeply believe in
- I will rise from the ashes
- Life lesson: always COMMIT your code, even if it's bad


How it happened
I ran initialize_git_repo script. It checks if the current repo is git or not and creates a new repo if it's not. Also fetch origin master
and runs git reset --hard
It was essentially a lot of factors that came together to try to defeat me and they did succeed for a short while

It was both a really good script and a bad one
Good - It works as intended and initializes the repo at the right folder, and does not create git repo in parent/children of the correct folder. If it initilized git repo in the parent, it would be a bigger disaster.
Bad - It didn't warn me (It's actually a feature).

Overall, I'm not mad, because my code worked as it wqas intended to. It was my fault for not being careful.
