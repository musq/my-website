Inspiration is perishable.

> *We all have ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever.*
>
> *What doesn’t last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It has an expiration date.*
>
> *If you want to do something, you’ve got to do it now. You can’t put it on a shelf and wait two months to get around to it. You can’t just say you’ll do it later. Later, you won’t be pumped up about it anymore.*
>
> *If you’re inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project. When you’re high on inspiration, you can get two weeks of work done in twenty-four hours. Inspiration is a time machine in that way.*
>
> *Inspiration is a magical thing, a productivity multiplier, a motivator. But it won’t wait for you. Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to work.*

> **--- Jason Fried, "Rework"**
