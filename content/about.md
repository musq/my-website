Hi, I'm Ashish. I love computers and the endless possibilities they
offer. Programming is to build beautiful products and contributing
to the [vision of Mr. Richard Stallman](https://youtu.be/L4qNuoSwmPo).

Stories about people who challenged the system for the betterment of
society fascinate me.

- Steve Wozniak brought color to personal computers
([source](https://youtu.be/uCRijF7lxzI))
- Phil Zimmermann released PGP's source code as a book to get around
US export law ([source]
(https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pretty_Good_Privacy#/Criminal_investigation))
- Pavel Durov and his journey of Telegram
([source](http://fortune.com/telegram-pavel-durov-mobile-world-congress/))
- Elon Musk on becoming a spacefaring civilization makes him get up
in the morning ([source](https://youtu.be/zu7WJD8vpAQ?t=1724))

**I believe in privacy as a fundamental right.**

On a lighter note, I occasionally make sketch portraits of happy
people :)

Enjoy!
